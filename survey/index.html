            In May 2025, voters in the Cotswold District will have the opportunity to vote in a local referendum to
            replace the 'Leader and Cabinet' system with the Modern Committee model. The District Council is currently
            set up so that all decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of the Leader and seven Lib Dem
            councillors (all appointed by the Leader), called the Cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other 26 councillors - Liberal Democrats, Conservatives, Greens and Independents - are locked out.
            Ordinary Cotswold voters can, however, use a provision of the Localism Act to ensure our council is run on a
            more democratic basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            3,481 signatures from residents of the Cotswold District (one twentieth of the total) would, by law, trigger
            a referendum and provide for an inclusive debate about scrapping the 'Leader and Cabinet' model and
            replacing it with the fairer and more democratic <a href='https://itsoursheffield.co.uk/referendum-faqs/'
                target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Modern Committee system</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The District Council will only accept your ‘real’ signature - you cannot sign this petition online. To add
            your name please either email Cllr Chris Twells or complete <a

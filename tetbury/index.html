        <div class="campaign-info">
            <strong>Tetbury is one of the largest towns in the South West that has no public swimming pool or leisure centre.</strong>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        We need to see urgent change in this town. Unfortunately, Tetbury Town Council has a well-deserved reputation as the most dysfunctional local authority in Gloucestershire. The Council only ever seems to make the headlines for the wrong reasons. Residents in Tetbury also pay more Council Tax than almost anywhere else in the Cotswolds - the average Council Tax bill in Tetbury is approx. £150 p.a. higher than any neighboring parish. At least two of the Town Councillors elected in 2023 had links to the BNP or the far right.
        </p>
        <p>
            How does TTC manage your money? Shockingly, an FOI request has revealed that <strong>more than £12,250 has recently been spent on new iPads for Town Councillors.</strong>
            The Town Councillors can keep their iPads at home, and there are no restrictions on how they can be used - whether that's streaming films, playing games, or messaging friends. If an iPad is lost or broken, guess who pays for the insurance? Yes - the taxpayer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fed up with stories like this about the Town Council and the general apathy about improving our town? A group of residents have come together to bypass the committee-sitters and work directly with the housing developers, the private sector and Sport England to deliver first-class leisure facilities for Tetbury and the surrounding villages. Back the campaign <a href='https://forms.gle/v6rxvviJaxneDLm29'>here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is part of a wider cross-party effort to secure an open and inclusive debate about scrapping the Town Council completely and replacing it with a fairer, more efficient and accountable system.
            The appalling manner in which our Town Council is currently run is an embarrassment to our wonderful town. In 2021 they handed over a £5,000 cheque to a Town Councillor - but they won’t explain why. In December 2023 the Chairman used taxpayers’ money and Town Council employees to organise a lavish Christmas party at the Snooty Fox, with free drinks for councillors.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Our Cotswolds is a cross-party pressure group campaigning to reform local government in Tetbury and across the Cotswold District.</strong> We're backed by Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green supporters - and indeed people who aren't aligned with any party at all.

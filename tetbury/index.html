            <strong>In the coming weeks, voters in Tetbury will have an opportunity to vote in a local referendum (a Parish Poll) on
            whether to effectively abolish Tetbury Town Council.</strong> The first step is to turn TTC into a "non-spending authority", in the process knocking around £150 off the average (Band D)
            Council Tax bill.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Tetbury Town Council has a well-deserved reputation as the most dysfunctional local authority in Gloucestershire. The Council only ever seems to make the headlines for the wrong reasons. Residents in Tetbury also pay more Council Tax than anybody else in the Cotswolds - the average Council Tax bill in Tetbury is approx. £150 p.a. higher than any neighboring parish. At least two of the Town Councillors elected in 2023 have links to the BNP or the far right.
        </p>
      
        <p>
            How does TTC manage your money? Shockingly, an FOI request has revealed that <strong>more than £12,250 has recently been spent on new iPads for Town Councillors.</strong>
            The Town Councillors can keep their iPads at home, and there are no restrictions on how they can be used - whether that's streaming films, playing games or messaging friends. If an iPad is lost or broken, guess who pays for the insurance? Yes - the taxpayer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fed up with stories like this about the Town Council? A group of Tetbury residents are using a provision of the Local Government Act to force the Town Council to hold a referendum (a Parish Poll) to test public opinion and consider replacing TTC with a Charitable Trust - in the process, knocking £150 from the average Council Tax bill. Tetbury would remain a Town, and all council assets would be secure.
            This will be a long process but if you would like to sign the petition and support Residents Against Bureaucracy in Tetbury (RABIT), you can do so <a href='https://forms.gle/v6rxvviJaxneDLm29'>here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is the beginning of an open and inclusive debate about scrapping the Town Council and replacing it with a fairer, more efficient and (frankly) more democratic system.
            The appalling manner in which our Town Council is currently run is an embarrassment to our wonderful town. In 2021, the Town Council cheerfully handed over a fat cheque of £5000 to one Town Councillor!

            <strong>Our Cotswolds is a cross-party pressure group campaigning to reform local government in Tetbury and across the
            Cotswold District.</strong> We're backed by Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green supporters - and indeed
            people who aren't aligned with any party at all.

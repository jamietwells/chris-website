    <p><strong><a href="opt-out-form.html">OPT OUT OF COMMUNICATIONS</a></strong></p>
    
    <p>The form asks for a reference (which can be found at the bottom of any letter - they don't need to add anything else. If they do not have a reference they can optionally provide a name and postal address and/or an email address and/or a mobile number. They can then tick a statement that says they wish to be opted out of all communications and they understand this may take 28 days.</p>
    
    <p>The Information Commissioner encourages political parties to engage with the electorate using leaflets, addressed letters, emails, etc.</p>

    <p>"It is vital in any democratic society that political parties and campaigners are able to communicate effectively with voters. But it is equally vital for the integrity of elections and democracy that all organisations involved in political campaigning handle and process personal data in a way that is compliant with data protection law. In recent years political campaigning has become increasingly sophisticated as new digital technologies and communication tools developed rapidly. Campaigners now use ever more innovative techniques to attempt to understand their potential voters and target them with political messaging."</p>

    <h2>Why the Gloucestershire Independents are permitted to use your data in this way</h2>
    <p>As a registered national political party in the UK, the Gloucestershire Independents are entitled to a copy of the full Electoral Register under the Representation of the People Regulations 2001. The full Electoral Register is different to the open Electoral Register as it contains details of all voters in the UK, including those who have opted out of the open register. We do contact voters outside of election periods, however, we will honour opt outs for this type of communication upon request. At a Parliamentary election, we are also permitted to send one Election Communication via Royal Mail to all electors under Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that in a democratic society like the United Kingdom, you cannot opt out of unaddressed political leaflets but we will do our best to respect your wishes if you do not wish to receive communication of this nature from the Party.</p>
    <h2>Right to Stop Receiving Communications</h2>
    <p>The Gloucestershire Independents are committed to respecting your right to control the communications you receive, in accordance with relevant legislation. This includes, but is not limited to, processing by registered political parties, candidates, referendum campaigners and non-party campaigners as specifically defined in the Political Parties and Referendums Act 2000, the Representation of the People Act 1983 and any other relevant electoral and data protection legislation.</p>

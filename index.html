        On Thursday 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2024, voters in the Cotswold District could have an opportunity to vote in a
        referendum to replace the 'Leader and Cabinet' system with the Modern Committee model. The District
        Council is currently set up so that all decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of the Leader
        and seven Lib Dem councillors (all appointed by the Leader), called the Cabinet.
        <p>
        <p>
        The other 26 councillors - Liberal Democrats, Conservatives, Greens and Independents - are locked out.
        Ordinary Cotswold voters can, however, use a provision of the Localism Act to ensure our council is run
        on a more democratic basis.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
        3,502 signatures from residents of the Cotswold District would, by law, trigger a referendum and provide for
        an open, fair and inclusive debate about scrapping the 'Leader and Cabinet' model and replacing it with the more
        democratic <a href='https://itsoursheffield.co.uk/referendum-faqs/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Modern Committee
        system</a>.

        Cross-party efforts in Sheffield, Bristol and elsewhere have led the way - grassroots campaigners have
        forced their councils to scrap the undemocratic Cabinet model, based on the Leader's feudal patronage.

        It's Our Cotswolds is an independent group campaigning to raise awareness of the benefits of a collaborative
        committee system. We're backed by Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green supporters - and indeed
        people who aren't aligned to any party at all.

            In May 2025, voters in the Cotswold District will have the opportunity to vote in a local
            referendum to replace the 'Leader and Cabinet' system with the Modern Committee model. The District
            Council is currently set up so that all decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of the Leader
            and seven Lib Dem councillors (all appointed by the Leader), called the Cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other 26 councillors - Liberal Democrats, Conservatives, Greens and Independents - are locked out.
            Ordinary Cotswold voters can, however, use a provision of the Localism Act to ensure our council is run
            on a more democratic basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            3,481 signatures from residents of the Cotswold District (one twentieth of the total) would, by law, trigger
            a referendum and provide for an inclusive debate about scrapping the 'Leader and Cabinet' model and replacing it with the
            fairer and more democratic <a href='https://itsoursheffield.co.uk/referendum-faqs/' target='_blank'
                rel='noreferrer'>Modern Committee system</a>.

            Cross-party efforts in Sheffield, Bristol and elsewhere have led the way - grassroots campaigners have
            forced their councils to scrap the undemocratic Cabinet model, which relies on the Leader's patronage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Cotswolds is an independent group campaigning to raise awareness of the benefits of a collaborative
            committee system. We're backed by Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green supporters - and indeed
            people who aren't aligned to any party at all.

            On Thursday 2<sup>nd</sup>> May 2024, voters in the Cotswold District have the opportunity to vote in a referendum to 
            replace the 'Leader and Cabinet' system with the 'Modern Committee' model. The District Council is currently set up so 
            that all decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of the Leader and 7 Lib Dem councillors, "the Cabinet". The
            other 26 councillors - Lib Dem, Conservative, Green or Independent - are excluded. With 3,502 signatures we can force
            CDC to adopt a more democratic system.
            <p>
            <p>
            It's Our Cotswolds is an independent group campaigning to raise awareness of the benefits of a collaborative committee
            system. We're backed by Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green supporters - and indeed many people who aren't
            aligned to any party at all.
            <p>
            <p>
            <strong>BACK THE CAMPAIGN TODAY</strong>

            <p>
            We need 3,502 signatures from residents of the Cotswold District to trigger a referendum and have an open, fair
            and inclusive debate about changing from the 'Leader and Cabinet' model to the democratic Modern Committee system.

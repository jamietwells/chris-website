    <p>
    On Thursday 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2024, voters in the Cotswold District could have an opportunity to vote in a referendum to 
    replace the 'Leader and Cabinet' system with the 'Modern Committee' model. The District Council is currently set up so 
    that all decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of the Leader and seven Lib Dem councillors, the Cabinet. The
    other 26 councillors - Liberal Democrats, Conservatives, Greens and Independents - are locked out. Ordinary Cotswold voters
    can, however, use a provision of the Localism Act to ensure our council is run on a more democratic basis.

    <b>Cross-party efforts in Sheffield, Bristol and elsewhere have led the way - grassroots campaigners have scrapped the
    undemocratic Cabinet model, based on the feudal Leader's patronage.</b>

    It's Our Cotswolds is an independent group campaigning to raise awareness of the benefits of a collaborative committee
    system. We're backed by Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green supporters - and indeed many people who aren't
    aligned to any party at all.

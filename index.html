            On 2nd May 2024, voters in the Cotswold District should have the opportunity to vote in a referendum to keep or to 
            replace the 'Leader and Cabinet' system with a modern committee system. The District Council is currently set up so 
            that all decision-making powers are concentrated in the hands of 8 Lib Dem councillors. The other 26 councillors - 
            Lib Dem, Tory, Green, Independent - are excluded. With 3,502 signatures we can force CDC to adopt a more democratic
            system.
            <p>
            <p>
            It's Our Cotswolds is an independent group campaigning to raise awareness of the benefits of a collaborative committee
            system. We're backed by Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green supporters - and indeed people who aren't
            aligned with any party at all.

            We need 3502 signatures from residents of the Cotswold District to trigger a referendum and have a big, fair
            and inclusive debate about changing from the 'Leader and Cabinet' model to the democratic Modern Committee system
